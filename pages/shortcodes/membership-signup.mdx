# `[obrn-membership-signup]`

Renders a dynamic frontend membership signup form, allowing logged-in users to subscribe to a specific membership plan with full support for payment gateways, tax calculation, and upgrade flows.

---

-   `id`: _(required)_ The post ID of the membership (`post_type = membership`) to display and subscribe to.

---

## Requirements

-   **User must be logged in** — otherwise, the message `Please sign in or register to take out a membership` will be shown.
-   **Membership must exist and be active** — inactive or invalid memberships will result in an error message.

---

## Features

-   **Dynamic fields**: Hidden inputs for user ID, currency, tax, and pricing.
-   **Upgrade support**: If `action=upgrade` and `proRatedPrice` are in the query string:

    -   Membership price is overridden.
    -   Hidden fields include `upgrade_action=1` and `subscription_id`.

-   **Multiple gateways**:

    -   Pulled from the `obrn_available_payment_methods` filter.
    -   Options include Stripe, PayPal, and Offline.

-   **Payment explanation text** is shown dynamically for each method.
-   **Terms & Conditions** and optional **newsletter opt-in** checkboxes.

---

## Hidden Inputs

The form includes data like:

-   `membership_id`, `membership_price`, `total_price`
-   `tax_rate`, `tax_amount`
-   `currency`, `gateway`, `paypal_orderId`, `user_id`
-   `upgrade_action`, `subscription_id`, `transaction_id`

---

## Price Summary Section

Includes:

-   Membership title and billing cycle
-   Subtotal and tax breakdown
-   Final total
-   Coupon code display (shown only when applicable)

---

## Submit Button Behavior

-   Disabled by default
-   Activated when:

    -   A payment gateway is selected
    -   Terms & conditions checkbox is checked

---

## Integration Notes

-   Uses `Oberon\Models\Membership`, `Oberon\Helpers\TaxHelper`, `Oberon\Helpers\L10nHelper`
-   Rendered fields and localized strings suggest strong integration with JavaScript/TypeScript-based logic for actual payment submission and validation.

---

## Usage

```php
[obrn-membership-signup id="123"]
```
