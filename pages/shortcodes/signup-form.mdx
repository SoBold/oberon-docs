# `[obrn-signup-form]`

Renders a two-step signup form that collects a userâ€™s email first, then conditionally reveals the password field upon validation or interaction.

---

## Features

-   **Two-step UI**:

    -   Initially displays only the **email address** field.
    -   The **password field** (`#obrnSignup__Form-Password`) is hidden by default and revealed via JS logic.

-   **Inline feedback**:

    -   A hidden `<div>` (`#loginMsg`) is included to show signup validation or error messages dynamically.

-   **Submit button**:

    -   Triggers the registration flow, typically handled via JavaScript/AJAX.

## Structure

-   `<form id="obrnSignupForm">`

    -   `user_email` input (shown)
    -   `password` input (hidden by default)
    -   `loginMsg` div (for displaying status/errors)
    -   Submit button

---

## Integration Notes

-   JavaScript logic is expected to:

    -   Reveal password field based on email validation.
    -   Handle form submission asynchronously.

-   Localization via `__()` supports multilingual use.
