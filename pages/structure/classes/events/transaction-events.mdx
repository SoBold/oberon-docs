# Subscription Transaction Events

## Overview

This `Subscription` event class handles transaction-related lifecycle events in the Oberon system. It hooks into custom WordPress actions to monitor completed, refunded, failed, and expired transactions associated with subscriptions.

### Usage

Instantiate this class during plugin bootstrapping to register all transaction event listeners:

```php
use Oberon\Events\Subscription;

new Subscription(); // Hooks into transaction-related subscription events
```

## Notes

-   Each method is a stub and should be implemented with business-specific logic such as logging, user notifications.
-   `$data` should be validated before use to prevent security issues or malformed operations.
