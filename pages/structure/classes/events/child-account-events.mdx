# Child Account Events

## Overview

The `ChildAccount` class defines event handlers for key actions related to child account subscriptions in the Oberon system. These events are hooked into custom WordPress actions and provide extensible points for responding to child account lifecycle events (request, accept, delete).

### Usage

This class is intended to be instantiated once during plugin initialization to bind its handlers to custom Oberon events.

```php
use Oberon\Events\ChildAccount;

new ChildAccount(); // Registers event listeners
```

## Class: `ChildAccount`

## Notes

-   All event methods are currently placeholders and should be extended to implement specific business logic (e.g., email notifications, logging, syncing with external services).
-   The `$data` array passed to each method should follow a consistent structure for predictability.
