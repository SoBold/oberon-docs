# Member Events

## Overview

The `Member` event class provides hooks for handling various lifecycle events related to member accounts in the Oberon platform. These include events like registration, login, updates, deletions, and credit card expiration handling.

### Usage

This class should be instantiated during plugin bootstrap to register the event listeners with WordPress:

```php
use Oberon\Events\Member;

new Member(); // Hooks into member-related events
```

## Class: `Member`

Handles WordPress actions for key member lifecycle events.

---

### Constructor: `__construct()`

Registers WordPress actions with their corresponding handler methods.

#### Registered Hooks:

-   `obrn_event_member_added` → `eventMemberAdded()`
-   `obrn_event_member_updated` → `eventMemberUpdated()`
-   `obrn_event_member_login` → `eventMemberLogin()`
-   `obrn_event_member_signup_completed` → `eventMemberSignupCompleted()`
-   `obrn_event_member_deleted` → `eventMemberDeleted()`
-   `obrn_event_member_before_credit_card_expires` → `eventMemberBeforeCardExpires()`
-   `obrn_event_member_after_credit_card_expires` → `eventMemberAfterCardExpires()`

#### Example:

```php
new Member();
```

---

### Method: `eventMemberAdded(array $data = []): void`

---

### Method: `eventMemberUpdated(array $data = []): void`

---

### Method: `eventMemberLogin(array $data = []): void`

---

### Method: `eventMemberSignupCompleted(array $data = []): void`

Fires upon completion of the member signup process.

---

### Method: `eventMemberDeleted(array $data = []): void`

Fires when a member account is deleted.

---

### Method: `eventMemberBeforeCardExpires(array $data = []): void`

### Method: `eventMemberAfterCardExpires(array $data = []): void`

---

## Notes

-   Each method is currently a placeholder for implementing business logic (e.g., logging, emailing, syncing).
-   The `$data` array passed to each event is expected to contain context like `user_id`, timestamps, or subscription metadata.
-   These hooks serve as the foundation for event-driven automation within the Oberon plugin architecture.
