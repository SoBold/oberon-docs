# `obrn_available_payment_methods` Filter

This filter allows to dynamically control which payment methods are available during the checkout or account setup flow. The availability is based on site configuration stored via the `MetaHelper` class and can be extended or overridden as needed.

---

## Purpose

Determines and returns the available payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Offline) based on stored gateway settings.

---

## Default Behavior

The filter retrieves gateway availability from saved site meta via:

```php
$gateways = json_decode($metaHelper->get('gateways'), true);
```

It then parses that to check which gateways are enabled:

```php
$args = wp_parse_args($args, [
  'stripe'  => true|false,
  'paypal'  => true|false,
  'offline' => true|false,
]);
```

---

## Example Output

When used, the filter might return:

```php
[
  'stripe'  => true,
  'paypal'  => false,
  'offline' => true,
]
```

---

## Usage Example

Override available payment methods manually:

```php
add_filter('obrn_available_payment_methods', function ($methods) {
    $methods['paypal'] = false;
    $methods['stripe'] = true;
    $methods['offline'] = false;
    return $methods;
});
```

---

## Use Cases

-   Disabling a specific gateway regardless of saved settings.
-   Dynamically toggling gateway availability by user role or subscription type.
-   Logging or debugging payment gateway state before display.

---

## Notes

-   **Hook name:** `obrn_available_payment_methods`
-   **Returns:** Associative array of gateway names mapped to booleans
-   **Source:** Uses `MetaHelper::get('gateways')`
