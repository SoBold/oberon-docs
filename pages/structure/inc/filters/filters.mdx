# WordPress Filter Loader

This file includes all the filter registration files used by the Oberon plugin for account management and user onboarding.

---

## Purpose

To organize and modularize WordPress filter logic in the `Oberon` plugin by including each filter definition from the `src/inc/filters/` directory.

---

## Included Filters

The following filter files are included and automatically loaded when the plugin initializes:

| Filter File                           | Description                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account-set-password-content.php`    | Sets labels and placeholders for the "Set Password" UI.                                                    |
| `account-remove-password-content.php` | Customizes content for removing a user password.                                                           |
| `account-change-password-content.php` | Provides default labels and placeholders for password change UI.                                           |
| `account-setup-fields.php`            | Defines how the account setup sections and fields are grouped and displayed.                               |
| `default-fields.php`                  | Contains core form field definitions used in account-related forms (e.g., first name, last name, address). |
| `available-payment-methods.php`       | Determines which payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Offline) are available based on meta config.            |
| `membership-signup-content.php`       | (Optional) Configures custom content displayed during the membership signup flow.                          |

## Best Practices

-   Add new filters by creating a file in `src/inc/filters/`, then include it here.
-   Ensure all files return valid filters using `add_filter()`.
-   Group filters by domain (e.g., account, memberships, payments) for clarity.

---

## Example

To add a new filter:

```php
// src/inc/filters/my-custom-filter.php
add_filter('my_custom_filter', function ($value) {
    return 'Modified: ' . $value;
});
```

Then include it:

```php
include(OBRN_BASE_PATH . '/src/inc/filters/my-custom-filter.php');
```

---

## Location

```php
File: /src/inc/filters/filters.php
```

This file is typically loaded during plugin load.

## Since
