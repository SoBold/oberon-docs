## How to retrieve child accounts from a subscription

Child accounts can be retrived by a method from the subscription model.

```php
$subscriptionController = new \Oberon\Controllers\SubscriptionController();
$subscription = $subscriptioncontroller->getSubscription({subscription_id});
```

Once you have retrieved the subscription, you can then call the method 'childAccounts' which will return an array of active and pending child accounts...

```php
$childAccounts = $subscription->childAccounts();
```

* Pending state means that they are yet to accept the invite
* Active state means they have accepted the invite

This will return empty if the subscription has no child accounts, or the membership doesn't allow for child accounts.

Example response

```php
[Array] => [
    [max_child_accounts]    => (int) {the memberships maximum child account count},
    [curr_child_accounts]   => (int) {a count of total child accounts, pending and active},
    [curr_active_accounts]  => (int) {a count of active child accounts},
    [curr_pending_accounts] => (int) {a count of pending child accounts},
    [child_accounts]        => (array) {list of colleagues}
]
```
