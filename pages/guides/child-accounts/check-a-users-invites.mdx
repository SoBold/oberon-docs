## How to check a users invites

To check if a user has any pending invites to a subscription you can use this method..

```php
\Oberon\Helpers\ChildAccountHelper::checkInvites({user_id});
```

This will return an array from the `obrn_child_account_requests` table which will either be empty (if none) or contain entries to subscriptions they have been invited to.
