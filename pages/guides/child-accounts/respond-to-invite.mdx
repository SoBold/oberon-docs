## How to respond to an invite

To respond to an invite, there is a helper function in the child account helper.

Params:

* $inviteId (int)    - The ID of the invite request
* $response (string) - Either "accept" or "decline"

Returns:

* (bool) - True if processed succesfully (both accept and decline), false if something went wrong

```php
\Oberon\Helpers\ChildAccountHelper::inviteResponse({invite_id}, {response});
```
