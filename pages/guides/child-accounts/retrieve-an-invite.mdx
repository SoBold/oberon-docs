## How to retrieve an invite

You can retrieve an invite by it's ID by using the follower method on the child account helper...
Params:

* $id (int) - The ID of the invite

Return:

* (bool/array)

The response either returns false if the invite doesn't exists, or if it does exist and array of the invite request as found in the `obrn_child_account_requests` table.


```php
\Oberon\Helpers\ChildAccountHelper::getInvite({invite_id});
```
