## How to check if child accounts are enabled

By constructing a Membership Oberon model you will have access to 2 properties...

* $enable_child_accounts (boolean)
* $max_child_accounts    (int)

The `$enable_child_accounts` property will either be true or false if the subscription is valid for child accounts and then provide a subsiquent `$max_child_accounts` proprty value of the maximum amount of child accounts that membership can have. If the child accounts are disabled for that particular membership then the `$enable_child_accounts` property will be false and the `$max_child_accounts` will be 0.

```php
$membership = new \Oberon\Models\Membership({membership_id});

// (output true for example)
$childAccountsEnabled = $membership->$enable_child_accounts;

// (output 10 for example)
$maxChildAccounts = $membership->$max_child_accounts;
```
