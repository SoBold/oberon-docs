## How to output a human readable version of the membership frequency

After constructing a membership model, you then have the available property of `formatted_price` which will return the period of a subscription into readable text. Such as 'Â£150 every 2 years' etc...

#### Example

```php
$membership = new \Oberon\Models\Membership({membership_id});
$readableFormat = $membership->$formatted_price;
```
