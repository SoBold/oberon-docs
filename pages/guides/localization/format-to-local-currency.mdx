## How to format to the local currency

If you have a number and want it formated to the local currency, you can do so via a helper function on the localization helper.

```php
$l10nHelper = new \Oberon\Helpers\L10nHelper();
$localized_price = $l10nHelper->formatToLocalCurrency({(mixed) number});
```

Returns:

* (string) - the formatted currency
