For commiting we use commitlint to standardize our commiting structure. You can find the reference here for the commiting standards we obid by.

### Branches

We primarly work on two branches. Main and Develop. Main is the production release and therefore anything pushed to production releases a new version. The develop branch is used for adding new features and fixing any bugs to be pushed to main. Prior to this however, all features and bug fixes will all need to be on custom branches and added as pull requests into the develop branch.
