## Test Endpoints

### Description
This class tests the functionality and reliability of the REST API endpoints within the Oberon package.

### Properties

- **server (WP_REST_Server)**: Holds the WordPress REST server object.
  
- **user (WP_User)**: Contains the WordPress user object used for testing.
  
- **apiBase (string)**: The base URL of the API.

### Setup
- Set up the parent test environment.
  
- Create a new user with an administrator role and set it as the current user.
  
- Initialize the REST API server.

### Tests

#### `testMembershipEndpoints`

- **Objective**: Test the membership endpoints to ensure they can accurately retrieve memberships from the database and handle search queries.

- **Actions**:
  - Create a test membership post of type `membership` with specific metadata.
  - Send a request to retrieve the specific membership using its ID.
  - Ensure the response is not an error and contains the correct membership instance.
  - Modify the request to execute a search operation and validate the returned results.

- **Assertions**:
  - Verify that the response data does not contain any WordPress error.
  - Confirm that the `membership` key exists in the response data and contains an instance of the `Membership` model.
  - Ensure the search query response contains the `totalCount` key with an integer value and the `memberships` key with an array of memberships.

### Teardown

- The function `tearDown` helps in cleaning up after the test operations. This is executed after all tests are run.
