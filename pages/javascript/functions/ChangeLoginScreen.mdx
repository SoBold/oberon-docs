## ChangeLoginScreen

### Overview
The `ChangeLoginScreen` function is responsible for toggling between the login and forgotten password screens on a login form. It checks the currently active screen and switches its visibility with the hidden one.

### Function Definition
```typescript
const ChangeLoginScreen = (): void
```

### Parameters
- **None**

### Returns
- **void:** This function does not return a value.

### Function Details
1. **Get Login Container:** The function starts by acquiring a reference to the container div with the ID `'obrnLogin__Container'`.

2. **Identify Active Screen:** Within the container, it identifies the login and forgotten password screens using their respective IDs (`'obrnLogin__Login'` and `'obrnLogin__Forgot'`). It then determines which screen is currently active.

3. **Toggle Screens:** Depending on the currently active screen:
   - If the login screen is active, it is hidden, and the forgotten password screen is shown.
   - If the forgotten password screen is active, it is hidden, and the login screen is shown.
   
4. **Update Class List:** The active class is removed from the currently active screen and added to the previously hidden one to mark the change in visibility.

### Dependencies
This function directly manipulates the DOM and relies on certain elements with specific IDs being present:
- **obrnLogin__Container:** The container that wraps both login screens.
- **obrnLogin__Login:** The actual login screen element.
- **obrnLogin__Forgot:** The forgotten password screen element.

### Usage
This function can be triggered, for example, by a button click or any other event, to seamlessly switch between the login and forgotten password screens without needing to reload or navigate to a new page.

### Version
- Introduced in version 0.1.0.
