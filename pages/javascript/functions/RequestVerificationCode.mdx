## RequestVerificationCode

### Overview
The `RequestVerificationCode` function is designed to request a verification code based on a specific action name provided. It's useful in scenarios where a user might be performing sensitive operations and needs a verification code to continue, such as changing passwords or verifying new devices.

### Function Definition
```typescript
const RequestVerificationCode = async (action: string): Promise<Response>
```

### Parameters
- **action (string):** This parameter denotes the name of the action for which the verification code is being requested.

### Returns
- **`Promise<Response>`:** This function returns a Promise that resolves to a `Response` object. This object has a `success` boolean field, indicating whether the request was successful, and a `message` field that holds any relevant message from the server.

### Function Details
1. **API URL Construction:** It constructs the API URL intended for requesting verification codes.
2. **Verification Code Request:** Executes a POST request to the constructed API URL, transmitting the action name.
3. **Response Handling:** Parses the server's response to derive and return the success status and any relevant message.

### Dependencies
- **obrnArgs:** This function leverages the `obrnArgs` object to acquire the API URL and other essential configurations.

### Usage
The `RequestVerificationCode` function plays a pivotal role in scenarios requiring additional user verification. Proper implementation ensures that users can securely and efficiently obtain verification codes for critical actions, thereby bolstering the application's security.

Requesting a code, you can find a full list of actions [here](/events) - The user comes from the corresponding nonce

```typescript
RequestVerificationCode('action').then(res=>{
    if (res.success) {
        //* code sent
    } else {
        //* other issue, message will exist
    }
}).catch(err=>{
    //* catch error
})
```
