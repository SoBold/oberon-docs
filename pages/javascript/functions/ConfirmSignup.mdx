# `ConfirmSignup`

## Overview

The `ConfirmSignup` function finalizes a userâ€™s registration by submitting payment-related data to the backend. It sends a **POST** request to the `/v1/auth/signup/complete` endpoint using the configured API URL and nonce for authentication. This function does not return any value but logs the response for further handling.

---

## Function Definition

```ts
const ConfirmSignup = async (paymentInfo: any): Promise<void>
```

---

## Parameters

| Name          | Type  | Description                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `paymentInfo` | `any` | An object containing payment and/or signup completion data to be submitted. |

---

## Returns

**`Promise<void>`**
This function resolves after the API response is received. The response is logged via `console.log` for debugging. No structured value is returned.

---

## Function Details

### Constructing the API URL

The endpoint is built using:

```ts
const apiUrl = obrnArgs.apiUrl + '/v1/auth/signup/complete';
```

### Authenticated POST Request

The function makes a `POST` request with:

-   Headers:
    -   `X-WP-Nonce`: Retrieved from `obrnArgs` for authentication.
-   Body:
    -   `paymentInfo`: Serialized to JSON and sent as the request payload.

### Response Handling

The function parses the response using:

```ts
.then(res => res.json())
```

and logs the result for future handling:

```ts
console.log('completeSignup', completeSignup);
```

> **TODO:** Error handling and response structure parsing should be added for robustness.

---

## Dependencies

-   **`ObrnArgs`**: Contains the API base URL and authentication nonce.
-   **`fetch`**: Native Fetch API is used to perform the HTTP request.

---

## Example Usage

```ts
await ConfirmSignup({
    transactionId: 'abc123',
    userId: 42,
    membershipId: 5,
    amountPaid: 29.99,
});
```

---

## TODO

-   Add error handling (`try/catch`) for network and server errors.
-   Define a specific interface for `paymentInfo`.
-   Consider returning structured success/failure responses instead of just logging.
