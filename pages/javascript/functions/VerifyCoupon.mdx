## VerifyCoupon

### Overview
The `VerifyCoupon` function serves as a mechanism to check and validate coupon codes. It sends a request to a custom REST API endpoint, aiming to validate the user-entered coupon code. The function will verify if the coupon is valid and determine if the user has the necessary permissions to apply the provided coupon.

### Function Definition

```

### Parameters
- **coupon (string):** The coupon code that needs validation.

### Returns

### Function Details
