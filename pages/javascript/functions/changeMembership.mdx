# `changeMembership`

## Overview

The `changeMembership` function facilitates the transition of a user's membership from one subscription plan to another. It sends a POST request to the API with the current and new membership IDs, the type of action (e.g., upgrade or downgrade), and optionally, a pro-rated price. The response indicates whether the operation was successful and includes relevant data or errors.

## Function Definition

```ts
const changeMembership = async (
  currentSubscriptionId: number,
  newMembershipId: number,
  membershipChangeAction: string,
  proratedPrice?: number
): Promise<ChangeMembershipResult>
```

## Function Details

### Constructing the API URL

The API endpoint is constructed using `obrnArgs.apiUrl` with the fixed path:

```
/v1/auth/signup/change
```

### Authenticated POST Request

A POST request is made with the following structure:

-   Headers:
    -   `Content-Type: application/json`
    -   `X-WP-Nonce`: Nonce token from `obrnArgs`
-   Body: JSON stringified payload containing the subscription and action data.

### Success Handling

If the server responds with a valid JSON payload, it is returned as the result.

### Error Handling

If the API call fails (e.g., due to network issues or server errors), a structured error response is returned:

```ts
{
  isValid: false,
  error: 'Error during API call. Please try again later.'
}
```

---

## Dependencies

-   **`ObrnArgs`**: Provides the API base URL and nonce for secure requests.
-   **`ChangeMembershipResult`**: Interface defining the expected response format from the API.

---

## Example Usage

```ts
const result = await changeMembership(123, 456, 'upgrade', 12.99);

if (result.isValid) {
    console.log('Membership changed successfully');
    console.log('Max child accounts allowed:', result.maxChildAccount);
} else {
    console.error('Failed to change membership:', result.error);
}
```
