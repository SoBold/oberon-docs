## StripeCreatePaymentIntent

### Overview
The `StripeCreatePaymentIntent` function is a crucial component for integrating Stripe payments. It's tasked with obtaining a `client_id` from the backend which is required by the Stripe SDK to process payments. To achieve this, the function communicates with a REST endpoint, sending the intended amount and currency type. The endpoint then generates and returns a client secret to facilitate the transaction.

### Function Definition
```typescript
const StripeCreatePaymentIntent = async (
    amount: number,
    currency: string
): Promise<string | boolean>
```

### Parameters
- **amount (number):** Represents the amount that is to be charged.
- **currency (string):** Specifies the currency type for the charge, e.g., 'USD', 'EUR', etc.

### Returns
- **`Promise<string | boolean>`:** The function returns a Promise. On success, it resolves to a string containing the client secret code. If the operation fails, it resolves to `false`.

### Function Details
1. **API URL Construction:** A URL is constructed to communicate with the relevant API endpoint that handles Stripe payment intents.
2. **Client Secret Request:** The function sends a POST request to the endpoint, passing the required `amount` and `currency` data.
3. **Handle Response:** Upon receiving a response, the function checks for any errors or failed intents. If there are issues, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it retrieves and returns the client secret.

### Dependencies
- **obrnArgs:** This function relies on the `obrnArgs` object to access the API URL and other necessary configurations.

### Usage
This function is specifically tailored for Stripe payments integration. It should be utilized whenever initiating a Stripe payment to securely fetch the required `client_id` from the backend.
