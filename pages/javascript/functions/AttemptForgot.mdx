## AttemptForgot

### Overview
The `AttemptForgot` function is designed to trigger the password reset sequence when provided with an email. It sends a REST API request to a custom endpoint and determines the success based on the response received.

### Function Definition
```typescript
const AttemptForgot = async (reset: Forgot): Promise<ForgotResponse>
```

### Parameters
- **reset (Forgot):** An object containing an email. This is used to initiate the password reset process.

### Returns
- **`Promise<ForgotResponse>`:** A promise that resolves to an object. If the process is successful, the object will contain a `success` property set to `true` and a `resetLink` property. If unsuccessful, it will return a `success` property set to `false` and a `message` property with information regarding the failure. If the request fails altogether, the function will return a generic message.

### Response Object Structure

| Property   | Type    | Description                                                                                                    |
|------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| success    | boolean | Indicates the success or failure of the function. `true` if successful, `false` otherwise.                       |
| message    | string  | A message providing information about the failure reason, if applicable.                                       |
| resetLink  | string  | (Optional) Contains the valid reset link when the function is successful. Otherwise, it will not be included.  |

### Function Details
1. **Construct the API Url:** The function constructs the API URL by concatenating the base URL from `obrnArgs.apiUrl` with the endpoint `/v1/auth/forgot`.
   
2. **Reset Password POST Request:** Using the Fetch API, the function sends a POST request to the constructed API URL. The request includes headers for authentication and the email for password reset in the body.
   
3. **Determine Success:** After sending the request, the function waits for a response. If a valid response is received, it returns the response. If there's an issue with the fetch request or it fails, a default error message "Something went wrong" is returned.

### Dependencies
- **Forgot:** An interface imported from `../../interfaces/Forgot`.
   
- **ObrnArgs:** An interface imported from `../../interfaces/ObrnArgs`. This is used to access the API's base URL and the nonce for authentication.

### Version
- Introduced in version 0.1.0.
