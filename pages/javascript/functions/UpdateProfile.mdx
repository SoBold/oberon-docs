## UpdateProfile

### Overview
The `UpdateProfile` function allows for updating user profile information via a custom REST API endpoint. By using this function, you can modify three primary attributes of a user profile: the first name, last name, and email. The server-side mechanism manages user authentication using nonces that are sent along as headers. When the profile update is successful, changes are reflected in the database. If any error occurs, the function will provide feedback in the form of the `ProfileResponse` object.

### Function Definition
```typescript
const UpdateProfile = async (
    profileData: ProfileData
): Promise<ProfileResponse>
```

### Parameters
- **profileData (ProfileData):** Contains the details that need to be updated. It should have:
  - **first_name (string):** The first name of the user.
  - **last_name (string):** The last name of the user.
  - **user_email (string):** The email address of the user.

### Returns
- **`Promise<ProfileResponse>`:** The function returns a Promise. On successful profile update, it resolves to an object containing the success status, message, and potential errors. In case of a failed request, a generic error message "Something went wrong" is provided with a `success` property set to `false`.

### Function Details
