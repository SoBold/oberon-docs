## CheckMembershipPriceValid

### Overview
The `CheckMembershipPriceValid` function is responsible for ensuring the validity of a membership's price by sending a request to the server. By passing in membership details, coupon data, and tax rates, the server checks if the client's calculated price matches its expectations. This is particularly useful to ensure that client-side pricing calculations have not been tampered with.

### Function Definition
```typescript
const CheckMembershipPriceValid = async (priceData: PriceData): Promise<boolean>
```

### Parameters
- **`priceData (PriceData)`:** An object containing membership details, tax rates, coupon data, and other relevant pricing details.

### Returns
- **`Promise<boolean>`:** Returns a Promise resolving to `true` if the price is valid, otherwise `false`.

### Function Details
1. **Construct Endpoint URL:** Utilizes the provided `priceData` to construct the appropriate API endpoint.
2. **Fetch Price Validation:** Sends a request to the server for price validation.
3. **Return Result:** Analyzes the server's response to determine if the price is valid or not. If the server returns no errors, the function resolves to `true`, otherwise it resolves to `false`.

### Dependencies
- **encodeDataToURL:** This function uses the `encodeDataToURL` helper function to serialize the provided `priceData` object into a query string format suitable for the API request.

### Version
- Introduced in version 0.1.0.
