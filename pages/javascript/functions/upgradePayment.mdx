# `upgradePayment`

## Overview

The `upgradePayment` function handles the backend communication necessary to initiate a payment flow for upgrading a user's membership. It sends the current subscription, the new membership, and optionally the pro-rated price to the API and returns a result indicating success, failure, or additional constraints (e.g., max child accounts).

## Function Definition

const upgradePayment = async (
  currentSubscriptionId: number,
  newMembershipId: number,
  proratedPrice?: number
): Promise<upgradePaymentResult>

## Function Details

### API URL Construction

The request URL is built by appending the following endpoint to the base API URL from `obrnArgs`:

```
/v1/auth/signup/change/payment
```

### Authenticated POST Request

The function performs a `POST` request with:

-   JSON body containing the subscription change data
-   Headers:
    -   `Content-Type: application/json`
    -   `X-WP-Nonce`: WordPress nonce for authentication

### Success Handling

The API response is parsed with `.json()` and returned as-is to the caller.

### Error Handling

If the fetch fails (e.g., network issue), the function catches the error and returns:

```ts
{
  isValid: false,
  error: 'Error during API call. Please try again later.'
}
```

---

## Dependencies

-   **`ObrnArgs`**: Contains the base API URL and authentication nonce used in the request.
-   **`upgradePaymentResult`**: Defines the structure of the API response returned by the function.

---

## Example Usage

```ts
const result = await upgradePayment(101, 202, 9.99);

if (result.isValid) {
    console.log('Upgrade payment initiated');
} else {
    console.error('Upgrade failed:', result.error);
}
```

---

## Notes

-   The commented-out `paymentFormEvent()` logic indicates a potential future integration with a payment form display logic via a DOM event.
-   You may consider exposing more details (e.g. transaction ID or redirection URL) in future iterations.
